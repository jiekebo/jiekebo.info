I have always been intersted in automata, procedural generation and artificial intelligence. I have always marveled at various visualizations of these and always wanted to know how they were made. Reading about Craig Reynolds' in this <a href="http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/boids/pseudocode.html">pseudocode</a> I decided to have a go at it.

So this is the result, having decent performance at 50 boids. Definitely there is room for improvement. Currently the vector library uses some functional-style currying which creates a new object each time a vector operation is perfomed, probably not very optimal. But the biggest sin is that a boid considers all boids in the simulation, and not just the ones in the vicinity. If that was to be done the performance would probably not get better since a distance from each boid, to each boid would have to be calculated at every frame. The remedy to this would be to use a spatial data structure like a quadtree.

Improvements coming soon...
